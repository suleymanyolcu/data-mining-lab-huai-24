# üìä Data Mining Lab Projects (AIN429)

## üìö Repository Overview
This repository includes three comprehensive data mining projects, each focusing on different analytical techniques:
1. **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:** Data integration, cleaning, scaling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
2. **Frequent Pattern Mining:** Implementation of Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for discovering frequent itemsets.  
3. **Classification and Clustering:** Supervised classification and unsupervised clustering applied to a real-world dataset.
